# Mental Rotation Task

This repository contains a basic mental rotation task using materials from Ganis & Kievit (2015).

## Experiment

The experiment uses a 2 (rotation: 50 degrees, 150 degrees) x 2 (match: same, different) within subjects design.

Participants view 48 pairs of images of 3D shapes and respond (forced binary choice) whether the images depict the same shape or different shapes (when rotated).
